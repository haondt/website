    - Title: Gabbro
      Description: >-
        My home server, which is split into two virtual machines, one as a deployment
        target and the other as a mini cloud environment. The cloud environment provides automation
        resources like a secret manager, runners, a deployment bot, etc. When changes are detected
        in the repo, the cloud environment injects secrets, builds configuration and deploys changes
        to the target machine. The target machine runs various services,
        hosts network storage and provides monitoring tools.

    - Title: Firefly III Post-Processor
      Description: >-
        A suite of tools to augment the rule system in Firefly III. In essence, this project allows
        you to process transactions in Firefly III through a Node-RED flow, allowing for much more
        powerful operations as compared to the built-in rule system.

    - Title: pyreminder
      Description: >-
        Pyreminder is a minimal tool for checking release statuses and sending notifications.

    - Title: medea
      Description: >-
        A command-line developers toolbox. Similar to projects like CyberChef and DevToys,
        it offers tools for quick text generation and processing, like creating hashes and parsing
        jwts.

    - Title: athena
      Description: >-
        A file-based rest api client. I built athena so I could store my api tests inside the same
        repo as the project. Additionally, it has a lot of benefits over other api clients, such as
        the ability to leverage python scripting, the ability to use any text editor as the UI and
        being extremely lightweight.

    - Title: Website
      Description: >-
        This website is built with ASP.NET MVC and htmx. It's mostly static, but there is some light
        scripting for the image carousels done with hyperscript. Deployment to a vps is handled
        automatically by GitHub Actions.

    - Title: Neovim Config
      Description: >-
        I maintain a fairly non-trivial Neovim config. My configuration includes plugins like
        nvim-tree and telescope, but I also have a number of extensions and plugins that I've
        written myself.
